# General Labs Guidelines:

• Read carefully both README files related to labs, and documentation inside .py files. 

• All labs must be done during class time, and must be commited to the repository by 9:45 pm. The only exception to this rule are labs 1 and 2 (take home labs).

• Commits done after class won't be taken into consideration. 

• If you miss a lab, you'll get a 0 in that lab. 

• In all labs, you must implement only the parts marked as TODO. Some parts of the labs will be already implemented by the instructor. If you modify those parts, it may affect negatively your grade in that lab

• Some labs contain unit test, so you can test if your output is correct before submitting. For labs that do not contain unit tests, sample output or additional intructions will be provided in the README file located in each lab folder. 

• Labs are graded based on their completness and correctness. 

• Commenting in your code is recommended, but not required due to the time constraint. 

• Each lab has its own readme file with specific docs and instructions.

• Failure to follow the labs rules may result in a negative grade.
